# Bioinformatics Immunology EMC Website 

## Overview

#### Why this website?
This is the website of our research group. We work in bioinformatics 
and we want to make our lab and work more public, we also aim
get in contact with other groups and  eventually stablish new collaborations. 
We also want to make our data more accessible and interactive to other people.
 
 
#### UX
In that case our intention was to make the interactive data as mobile-first responsive but, 
it was not possible for some graphs to reduce more than certain size to be readable.
 This website was designed thinking in other researcher which want to know a bit more about
our group and our work and get in contact if they want to collaborate. In is not easy, in 
The official EMC website find information of an small group, EMC web is also not aesthetic 
to keep the interested of new collaborators.

I didn't use any computer wireframes or mockups, I did use paper wireframes, I took a picture 
to include them here (assets/images/MilestoneOne_wireframe.jpeg)


#### Features
##### Existing Features
The Contact form is working but it is not fully functional because, there is no real alert to 
anyone within the team when someone submits the form.



##### Features Left to Implement
The contact will be fully functional, and we will create a database to keep record of the
possible collaborators.When we collaborate in more projects we will include them in the work and 
project sections.




#### Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- PyCharm IDE
- Git
- GitHub 
Public repository for the project 

- Bootstrap
To give our project a simple, responsive layout.

-JQuery
It is needed to have dynamic elements as the collapse button in the navbar

-Javascript
  - d3.js
  - crossfilter
  - dc.js
  - plotly.js
  - queue.js




#### Testing 
 
All pages were tested locally and on GitHub using Chrome, Firefox or Safari developer 
tools. The tests were mainly checking the responsiveness of all pages in different sizes, 
using iPhone5/6/7/8/X, Galaxy android phones, iPad 1/2/3/Pro and desktop. All links were tested 
along with the YouTube videos. The contact form was tested trying to submit the form empty or 
incomplete to be sure that all requirements fields must be filled before submitting.  


#### Deployment

Website was coded using PyCharm, a local Git was used for version control and then 
uploaded to GitHub using MacOX, well the Terminal window in PyCharm. Once in GitHub
it was made live using GitHub pages. The Website can be found at:

#### Credits

##### Content
The content of the project is original from the project I am working on and 
collaborating with other professionals in my department

##### Media
The photo for the home page was created as a logo for me from a friend, we did it 
together I cut my name and add the background. The figures for the projects were generated 
during the analysis of the data and they are originals.

I got Inspiration for this project looking into other website from bioinformatics Labs
